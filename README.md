## How to install?

1. Download the latest version available [here](https://mm.weareten.ca/latest).

3. Launch the installer and choose a location for the software. (You should not select your Among Us directory!)

4. Everything is set up! :)

## How to use it?

- Launch Mod Manager from Windows (use the shortcut or the search bar).

- A window will open.

- Choose a mod and download it using the button on the left.

- Once done, start a mod by clicking the launch button, which replaced the download button.

- You are ready to play! :)

## Making a mod compatible with Mod Manager

Publish a release in a public GitHub repository for your mod. In this release, you can add either (or both):

- The .dll file of the mod

- A .zip with the Among Us modded directory

Then, join the [discord](https://goodloss.fr/discord) and send your repository link. It will be a pleasure adding your mod. :)
